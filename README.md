# About Me

I'm a fullstack developer and musician based in Chicago, IL. Outside of tech, I'm also a [musician](https://www.cuckooandthebirds.com) and an avid fan of Star Trek.

I have a passion for learning new technologies, and I'm always looking to learn more. For business inquiries, please email me at [tyler.a.earls@gmail.com](mailto:tyler.a.earls@gmail.com).

# Portfolio

This repository is the source code for my tech portfolio, built lovingly with [Next](https://nextjs.org), a modern web framework built with React. I also use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) in my components, and [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) to serve images from a cloud-based data store that are optimized for the web.

# Previous Iterations

1. The first [iteration](https://github.com/taearls/portfolio-nuxt) of this website was built with [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org). I pivoted away from this stack because I was fascinated by Rust-based web frameworks.

2. The second [iteration](https://github.com/taearls/portfolio-rs) was built with [Yew](https://yew.rs), a Rust-based web framework with React-inspired APIs. I pivoted away from this stack because over the course of a year, it seemed that this project was slow to progress and I wanted to stay sharp on the technologies I use in my day-to-day professional work.
