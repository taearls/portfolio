## Notes

### Assumptions

1. React Compiler is production-ready for React 19
2. Current component patterns are generally compatible
3. No major architectural changes required
4. Development velocity: ~10-15 hours/week

### Out of Scope (For Now)

- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Advanced analytics/tracking
- Multi-language support
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features
- Backend API development

### Future Considerations

- Consider SSR/SSG after React Compiler stabilizes
- Evaluate Next.js vs Remix for future SSR needs
- Explore PWA features for offline support
- Add analytics for user behavior insights
